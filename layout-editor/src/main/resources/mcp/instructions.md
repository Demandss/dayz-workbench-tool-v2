You are connected to the DayZ Layout Editor. It edits .layout files of the DayZ GUI and draws them the way the game does.
The tools read and write only inside the work drive and the folders of the connected mods; files inside the game's PBO are read-only.

## Start
1. editor_status: what is open, and where things are (work_drive, game_folder, mod_folders).
2. Find the layout. list_layouts searches the .layout files of the connected mods (query narrows it). open_layout opens one; create_layout makes a new file and opens it.
3. get_tree shows the widgets with ids, types, properties and the computed rectangle in pixels (max_depth keeps it short). get_widget and find_widgets look at single widgets.

## Change and check
- Change: set_properties; set_properties_many (one property on many widgets, by names or name_regex: the states of repeated rows, the colours of a bar); add_widget and add_widgets (many at once); copy_widget (a widget with its children, many times); rename_widget; move_widget; delete_widget. Every change is a step of undo.
- get_layout_text and replace_layout_text read and replace the whole text of the layout, for a large restructuring.
- Look at the result with screenshot. Mode preview draws the layout as the game does. Area screen gives only the screen of the layout in exactly its own pixels. Use mode preview_workbench only to compare with Workbench 1.30. Take a screenshot of a test layout before the real screen.
- get_problems lists what the editor thinks is wrong. The answers of the tools carry warnings (an unknown property, a style the game does not know): read them.
- save_layout writes the file. Do not leave a layout modified and unsaved when the task is done.

## The .layout format
- Property values are written as they stand in the file: text and paths in quotes ("set:Icons image:Cross"), numbers and flags without.
- A property name with a space (text color, exact text size) is given without quotes: the file writer quotes it. A name the editor does not know is written all the same, with a warning in the answer.
- "exact text size" must be a whole number. Workbench 1.30 stops reading the layout after a widget with a fractional size and shows nothing of what follows, while this preview still draws it.
- position and size are pixels when hexactpos/vexactpos and hexactsize/vexactsize are 1, otherwise shares of the parent (0.5 is half).
- halign and valign anchor to the parent: left_ref, center_ref, right_ref (and top_ref, bottom_ref). A bare center does not centre.
- color is r g b a from 0 to 1. The editor reads it as sRGB, like the game. Workbench 1.30 reads it as linear light and shows it lighter.
- Names of widgets are Latin letters, digits and underscore, because scripts find a widget by name (FindAnyWidget).

## Building a layout
- Group the widgets by logical blocks (Header, ToolBar, MainInfo, Progress, RewardsList, Footer): every block is a Frame or Panel with the rectangle of the block, and its children are placed relative to it. Not a flat list in the root, no parent with more than about 9 children.
- A text is cut at the left and right edge of its parent widget (measured in Workbench): a text placed left of its parent loses its first letters. Keep the text inside the parent.
- Text has no line breaks: \n shows as it is. Give each line its own TextWidget, or set wrap 1 so that it wraps by the width of the widget.
- The screen of the editor has fixed resolutions (set_view resolution). A page taller than 1080 px is seen whole at 3840x2160, or in parts by moving the root.
- A ButtonWidget and an EditBoxWidget do not take exact text size (the button font follows its height: use a bitmap font of the size you need). A button needs its own text color, and an EditBox has no inner margin for the text.
- To change one property on many widgets use set_properties_many, not one call each.

## Fonts and texts
- list_fonts gives the paths that exist; put one in quotes into font. The game has no monospaced font, and a name that is not in the list is drawn as Metron.
- The built-in bitmap fonts (metron, metron-bold ...) come in the sizes 12, 14, 16, 22, 28, 48 and 58 only: exact text size does not scale them. For other sizes use an sdf_* font, or make a font of the size you need with convert_font.
- measure_text gives the width a text takes with a font and a size, so no screenshot is needed to fit it.
- A text that is #KEY (#STR_Craft) is a key of a stringtable.csv. The editor draws the text of the key in its own language, and leaves the text as it is when the key or the language is not there. list_strings finds keys of the game and of the connected mods; prefer a key to a literal text in layouts of a mod that has a stringtable.

## Pictures, icons and styles
- Icons come from imagesets: list_icons gives set:NAME image:IMAGE, which goes into image0. list_imagesets names the imagesets. Textures go into imageTexture with a path from the mod folder.
- An icon from an imageset that has transparent parts needs mode blend and "src alpha" 1 on its ImageWidget, otherwise it is drawn with a black square behind it (as the game does). A tint is the widget color.
- Styles: list_styles for a widget class, then set the style property. A style that list_styles does not show for the class draws nothing in the game, and the tools warn about it.
- A panel without a style draws nothing. For a flat fill of its color use style rover_sim_colorable on a panel. The style Colorable exists for buttons, windows, scrolls and spacers; on a panel the game draws nothing for it. On a button Colorable colours the text too.

## Own assets
- Shapes and icons of your own are white to black on a transparent background: the colour is given by the widget, not baked into the picture. A widget tints its picture by multiplication, so white takes the widget color fully, grey half, black stays black; one white shape serves every colour. Set color on the widget that carries the style or the image (a button, a panel, an ImageWidget), not on the picture. create_imageset with mask true turns coloured pictures into such masks.
- create_imageset packs pictures into an atlas and an .imageset. create_style writes a widget style (nine slots of images per state) into a .styles file. register_assets puts both into config.cpp so that the game loads them. convert_texture and convert_font make single textures and fonts.

## Scripts
get_script_template returns an Enforce Script class for the active layout (kind menu, component or widgets): the widget members, the lookup, the events of buttons and inputs and the registration of a menu. Use it as the base of the script file instead of writing the lookup by hand.
