/*
 * What `fixaspect` does, measured in Workbench 1.30 on panels in containers of three shapes (probe layouts of the
 * test stand, 20 cells):
 *
 * - It acts on a child whose size is relative on both axes. A pixel size is left alone whatever the value is.
 * - The ratio comes from the numbers of `size` (`1 1` is 1:1, `0.5 0.25` is 2:1). For a picture it is the ratio of
 *   the texture, which is an assumption, since the probes had no texture.
 * - `inside` is the largest box of that ratio that fits the parent, `outside` the smallest that covers it,
 *   `fixwidth` keeps the height the size gave and takes the width from the ratio (the name says the opposite).
 * - The box is pinned to the top left corner of where the widget would be, and it may stick out of its parent.
